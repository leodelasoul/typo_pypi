/*

 YARA doesn't perform complete digital certificate chain validation.

 This can cause unwanted matches for:
    a) Files that are signed with non-verified, self-issued, certificates
    b) Files that fail integrity validation due to checksum mismatch
    c) Files that have extra data appended after the certificate

 It's also worth mentioning that the timestamp value in the condition is only
 informative, since YARA doesn't extract timestamping certificate information.
 This information could be used in combination with other tools to reduce
 potential false positives.

 ReversingLabs recommends using Titanium platform for best results with certificate-based classifications.
